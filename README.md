[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/edsu/summoner.png)](http://travis-ci.org/edsu/summoner)

Work with the [Serial Solutions Summon API](http://api.summon.serialssolutions.com/) from Python.

To run the tests you'll need to set the `SUMMON_APP_ID` and `SUMMON_SECRET_KEY`
in your environment.
